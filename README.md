# NFPaisanos Challenge

## 📝 Description

Welcome! This is my submission for the NFPaisanos challenge.

The challenge is about creating a web app that shows a list of NFTs and allows the user to filter them by name, price, rarity, and sort them by price, date, likes among other things.

#### 🏆 The Manija Trophies 🏆

- Sort by
  - Oldest, Newest
  - Least liked, Most liked
  - Lowest bid, Highest bid
  - Lowest price, Highest price
- Rarity filter
- Search by author, because the auctions don't have a name

The reason behind why the `liked` filter was deleted is because I integrated it with the `sort by` filter and it was redundant.
